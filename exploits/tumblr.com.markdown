title: Tumblr.com â€” vulnerability
---

Tumblr, quite a large social network yet very vulnerable to attack. I have
deployed multiple exploits with no problem in the past, however, one of my
exploits seems to have been "patched" in a way that if I were to edit that post
and save it, I would lose my exploit. Okay, I'll just leave it and not edit it
:-) Still active from when I wrote it last year. I am unsure if this was an
action of Yahoo or tumblr themselves as I hadn't tested this after writing it
before Yahoo bought tumblr with their promise to ["Not To Screw It
Up"][yahoo-tumblr].

My tumblr account
=================

My tumblr username is as I generally do for my testing is `darknfoxy`. Here
I have all my XSS exploits to prove where there are flaws in their XSS filters.

<http://darknfoxy.tumblr.com>

Blog post with javascript
=========================

The first thing I attempted to do when I started playing around with tumblr was
make a few posts and it didn't take long for me to notice that I could put
anything in there, so I decided to add in a little javascript that would display
to the user their cookie and emailed tumblr. No response, oh well; I'm sure
someone will have more fun until they fix this.

Tumblr got hacked, many times!
==============================

Tumblr has been hacked quite a number of times due to their inability to secure
their code. Since the start of the year when I first registered, I hadn't been
on tumblr much at all so I've decided to go over it again to find as many
vulnerabilites that I can find for the present day.

Stupid filters
--------------

Since returning to tumblr I have noticed that they have made some attempts to
prevent people from running any code of their choice to do anything they want.
I have to say, their filters are stupid and as they may prevent someone from
being bothered finding other ways to execute their code but their current
filters are useless against real attacks and pentesters like myself. 

- `javascript:` -> `disabled:`

- `data:` -> `disabled:`

- `/tumblr.com/tumblr.js` -> `/tumblr.com`\
  Evaded by using `/tumblr.com/tumblr.xss`. .js is only a convention afterall.\
  I found this when editing my theme to run my code as a first checkpoint to
  execute. I at first tried using `/tumblr.com/tumblr.js/tumblr.js` but it had
  eaten both instances of `/tumblr.js`.
