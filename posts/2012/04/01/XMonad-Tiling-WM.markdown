**[Draft] I'm not finished writing this post!**

_Okay, as some people who know me from the [Arch community](http://archlinux.org/) might know, I'm always
trying different things on my computers. This is my first post for my blog, so please keep in mind I'm new
to blogging!_

 This article/blog post I'm attempting to put together today is about [XMonad](http://xmonad.org/). XMonad
 is a tiler window manager written and configured completely in haskell! XMonad is written in \~1000 lines
 of haskell, so it is very minimal however powerful! xmonad-contrib is packed with modules that you might
 decide to use.

 For some time now, I've been using XMonad as my desired wm (window manager). Before I was using XMonad as
 my only wm, I was always confused with the syntax of haskell. ( Hassel of a language to get used to.
 ) Once you first start XMonad ( w\\o configs ) you will see a blank X11 screen, Don't worry; just hit the
 keys M-S-\<Return\> ;) Okay, don't panic if you don't understand what that meant here I will make you
 a tiny table. :) Instead of going through every keybinding in a large table, I thought it would be far
 nicer to just give you the XMonad vanila ( default )

 In my experience with XMonad the only issue I've had is just the layout crashing, seems to be something
 in my configs.

 Here is a screenshot of my desktop.

 **My configs have been uploaded to [github](http://github.com/), in my ["dotfiles"
 repository](https://github.com/hh-darkfox/dotfiles).  Note: For my XMonad configs, I can't take much
 credit for as I just took [Vodik/Simon gmzlj](https://github.com/simongmzlj/dotfiles)'s configs and
 applyed custom tweaks and personal improvements.**
