[automatic image categorisation](http://www.physorg.com/news3966.html)

This seems pretty sweet.  Google could use this technology to further optimize its image search.  I could use this technology to get the pictures on my website arranged!

Amazing to imagine that we are now living in a time that computers *don't* recognize what's in photographs.  Seriously.
