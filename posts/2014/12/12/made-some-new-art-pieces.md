I'm not sure what to call them; they're not really drawings, nor are
they paintings..  They'll eventually be pieces of a maze puzzle thing.

I'll draw a maze or two behind them; I drew some dots on the edges where the maze paths would cross over the different panels, but I made a mistake that will require drawing some more pieces.  Maybe it was intentional so I wouldn't have 4 pieces as a set, because four is unlucky in Japan.
