[Source Reveals Secret UFO Meeting at U.N.](http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0208/unmeeting.html)   


> A date of 2013 was given as the time for official disclosure and/or when extraterrestrials show up in an unambiguous way. In the interim there will be acclimation related releases of information. Importantly, the source revealed that the events leading up to official disclosure will involve more ethically oriented extraterrestrials, and they will not pose a military threat to the world.  


  
I can't really understand the POV (author vs audience) of this article; it seems like it's a copy of a transcript or something.. but anyway, I like this kinda thing when dates are given.. Nice juicy dates that aren't too far away. I can wait until 2012. Er, I mean 2013.
