Hey guys, sorry I haven't really been an active blogger. I'm gonna try to keep this all up to date. It's
been quite a while since I touched this blog so I thought that I'd re-write it from scratch and begin
again.

Previously, I was generating everything dynamicly using [PHP]. I knew it was ineffecient when I wrote it;
but it was about 27 lines; but I never went back to make it static until now. As of a few days ago, this
blog has been powered by [Hakyll], a project written in [Haskell] which I intend to help with the flow of
it's development.

## Git no more, darcs to the rescue!  I am no longer using git to manage my configuration files.
Everything (soon) will be in my darcs repositories.

Check here for [my darcs repository][MyDarcs].

## Screenshots!!?! Screenshots you say? Here you go!
