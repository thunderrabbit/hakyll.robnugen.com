Hello visitor,

My name is James McGlashan, I am a 16 year old student and my occupation is
a freelancing pentester and programmer. Since I was 6 years of age, I have had
a website and forever been wanting to learn how everything works on a computer,
where the weaknesses are and how to find a solution to any problem in question.

I care for and respect privacy and security, throughout my blog I intend to
publish all of my penetration test reports along with exploit code for other
people to learn and join the game.  When I have the time, I will go around on
different networks in search of vulnerabilities. I don't use other people's
code, if I find a problem and a solution, I would still write my own code as
I believe that writing the code and exploits is much better to get the
understanding base to other and similar problems.

My current programming and testing computer is a cheap ultrabook; MEDION AKOYA
S4216. Cheap yet powerful enough for me with my needs. Dualcore i5 with a clock
speed of 1.8Ghz and hyperthreading and hardware virtualization supported. 8G of
ram, I'd be lucky to even use 1G. I am currently booting from a 32G USB2.0
flashdrive that has everything encrypted and compressed. My preference for
operating system is [Arch Linux].

Programming and scripting
=========================

My main programming and scripting languages are as of the following.

- [Haskell]
- JavaScript
- Shell scripts (preference zsh)
- [PHP]

PGP Key
=======

You can fetch my GPG key from [/DarkFox.pgp][MyPGP] so you can email me with
confirmation that it is I talking to you and to check any packages or files that
I host on this server.

``` haskell
~ >> gpg --list-keys --fingerprint darkfox
   | grep fingerprint
  Key fingerprint = C1E2 CD0F AC92 5360 CD82  8456 B19F 5C9A 7156 0F92
```

Projects and groups that I am currently apart
=============================================

I am apart of multiple networks of people, I am forever on IRC in the following
channels:

- [##security]
- [#archlinux-offtopic]
- [#archlinux]
- [#hackerhaven-offtopic]
- [#hackerhaven]
- [#hakyll]
- [#haskell-blah]
- [#haskell]

[Hackerhaven] is a shell provider; in fact I've moved my blog here because
I have more power having everything in this cloud instead of on my Dad's server
without even shell access. With Hackerhaven, I have the ability to easily and
securely manage multiple things and to keep my IRC client always accessible
without having multiple clients and therefore loosing context and backlog.
I sometimes even when on the way home from school go on my phone; N900 for
reference; and ssh into the shell to check IRC.

My current environment
======================

Below are a few screenshots of my [XMonad] desktop.
