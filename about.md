This is the fourth incarnation of my online journal.  I think I'll use it for a while, if I actually start using it.  Links to the incarnations:

1. [perl] (1998-2012)
2. [wordpress] (2012-2013)
3. [koken] (2013-2014)
4. [hakyll] (2014- ?)

Super thanks to [DarkFox] for his hakyll blog on darcs: [http://hub.darcs.net/DarkFox/DarkFox-blog](http://hub.darcs.net/DarkFox/DarkFox-blog)
Source code is available on github: [https://github.com/thunderrabbit/hakyll.robnugen.com](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/hakyll.robnugen.com)

But the repo will (probably) get blown away after [hakyll-journal](https://github.com/thunderrabbit/hakyll-journal) reaches v1.0.
